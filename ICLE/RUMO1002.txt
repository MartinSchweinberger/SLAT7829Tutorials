But I believe it is untrue. Humanities and sciences are not separated from real life. Their bases lay upon laws, invention, real events and so on.
Having been awarded a degree, a young man is clever enough to start his career in different areas of life. For example, a Master of Law is smart in laws. I am sure any enterprise will take him willingly. Certainly, it will take some time for him to get used to employing his theoretical knowledge on practice. Economics is also needed in everyday life. An underground student begins adjusting economical laws to events around him during last years of study. This happens, I believe, out of the statement that an individual and a society are not seperated from each other. It is impossible to live in the society and to be free, to be out of it.
But there are some areas which cannot be practical, history for example. This humanity is of little practical value. And a Bachellor of History can be either a scholar or a teacher of history.
However, every area of knowledge, such as chemistry or math for instance, could be converted into practice, earlier or later. Even if a young man didn't go into a related field of work, his knowledge would be useful. Transfering a proverb, I dare say: knowledge got is practice gained.
