The fact that foreigners are no longer welcome in Germany is known to the public at least since the asylum debates at the Bundestag, which were the main issue of German newspapers for a long time.
Still many ignorant people disagree with the fact that they hate foreigners although they insult them in every day life, because they split the foreigners selfishly into two groups.
The one is that of clean, friendly and polite foreigners who have a good working position and know German sometimes better than the germans itself. The other one is, that's the way they think, the group of dirty, garlic smelling strangers who are bums and live in flop houses. And this group of foreigners reduces his money, given by the state and the "good" German citizens in some honky tonks. Of course, the first group is lovable, enriches our cultural knowledge on other countries, the second one, well no matter what happens to them as attacks on their houses prove. These feelings towards foreigners, no matter where they come from encourages some small groups to forget the things that have been taught to them in family and school, if something has been taught to them at all.
Minorities like those form the image of the typical German citizen in the newspapers all over the world and people protesting against these movements with burning candles or stickers on their jackets feel weak against the brutality with which their opponents have armed themselves.
All these influences destroy the idea and the concept of a melting pot society in Germany.
