To say that it is no value in compulsory service is to say nothing. Sure, compulsory military service has a great number of disadvantages. It takes a lot of time to train a soldier to accomplish his missions. But 18 months are hardly enough for it.
At the same time military service is good life school for future. Young men are getting wiser while serving. But still it is true that young men join the Army unwillingly. In the same way they study military specialities.
In comparison with compulsory military service professional one is much better. There are more possibilities to train young men to be real soldiers, more control levers to keep discipline in the proper way. More attention may be paid to special and combat military training as well as to the political and social aspects of service.
None the less, only rich, well-developed industrialized countries may afford to establish the professional army for it takes a great deal of money to maintatin it. In spite of reducing the number of servicemen the army budget should be increased. Quality should prevail over the quantity. Hence Armament Acquisition and Procurement program would take more and more allocations.
People should join the Army willingly. But to provide it, social and financial support of service must be sufficient. While serving, a man should not think of his rear, should not settle such problems as where he would live in a month or how to extend his small salary until he gets the next one.
Otherwise it would be impossible to establish the powerful and combat-ready army for nobody would go into service being homeless and poorly sponsored.
