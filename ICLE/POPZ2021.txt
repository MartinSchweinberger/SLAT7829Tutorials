Terms of address can be divided into two main groups. One of them includes "v-forms", that is the forms that are to be used while addressing people we know well, our subordinates, or children. "Sie-forms" are reserved for addressing strangers and people with higher social status than that of a speaker. These forms and their usage have changed during the development of languages. Such changes happen gradually and to be anchored in a given language, most of its speakers must feel it necessary. Therefore, any attempts made by one social group to influence the pattern of terms of address are doomed to failure.
As a good example of such a failure may serve an introduction of a new "v-form" by the communists in Poland. This form, which was taken from Russian, did not suit the needs of Polish language and sounded out of place. Poles simply felt this form strange, and in spite of an enormous effort made by the communist government to implant it into Polish language, they ignored it. This resentment made this form leave our country about thirty years before the communism.
A very similar attempt to  change the pattern of terms of address by one of the social groups, according to many Americans, taking place in their country. It is undertaken by the salespersons who are trying to get quickly on a first-name basis with their prospects. They do it in order to gain false intimacy and use it to obtain advantages. Because such practises cause more and more resentment among people exposed to it, there is no chance that they will have any long lasting effect on American address pattern.
Communists, salespersons and many others seemed not to realise that forms of address cannot be changed by one social group to serve its needs. Language is too complicated structure to allow for such manipulation. If small fractions of speakers could introduce changes, communication would be threatened.
