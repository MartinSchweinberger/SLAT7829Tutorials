<ICLE-GE-AUG-0077.1>

Often I have asked myself whether to risk my "young life" for a peaceful UN mission in Somalia.
As I have joined the army for 12 months I have experience enough to assume that not only me but also about 90% of the boys whom I have met there would be willing and would be glad to make use of their "military knowledge" for "humanitary help" even if they run the risk to be shot by an enemy's machine-gun.
I think that the drill, the hard psychological and physiological training and the technical knowledge of "Logistic-Troups" provide the best prepared men to put an end to terror, hunger and fear in Somalia.
But as I'm not the father of little children yet and as I'm not married with a woman whose happiness would certainly cease in the case of taking part in a mission like this it's much more easier for me to agree.
Provided that my stay in Somalia would not endure longer than half a year I can sincerly say that to sacrifice this period of time in order to help the poor hungry people would be an honour for me.
