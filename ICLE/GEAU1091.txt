With the increasing number of private television channels that are not financed by the government commercials have taken an important status in the programmes. Wether they are of high quality, well and artificially done or simply silly they always have a high impact on the consumers' minds.
Watching an interesting report or a thrilling movie you get angry about tasty sausages and pet food, chromy cars driving through wild sceneries, thoothpastes for a brilliant smile, the latest scream in sportswear or whatever useful things there are that is created a need for four times per hour. By switching you cannot escape the commercials: all channels broadcast these spots at the same time. And as most people do not switch off the TV or leave the room four times per hour the commercials can work on the watchers' minds with full power.
They influence the consumer subconsciously, create needs for things or special brands one would not think of without commercials and direct people's consuming behaviour. This is a fact that was proved by independent tests several times. The watcher has no conscious control over the effects TV-commercials exert on him and he cannot escape them except by switching off the TV. For that reasons the spots should be banned.
