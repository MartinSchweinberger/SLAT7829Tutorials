The modern world is packed with engineering and equipment. They are everywhere around us. People live by laws of science. At present only few tribes in distant areas can live without science and engineering. Technology dominates our lives and minds. Some of us start thinking like machines.
The number of romantics and poets is decreasing. The Nature is retreating as cities and towns are growing in number. But still there are places for dreaming and emagination. Galant travellers are seeking for the places all over the world. They are trying to find lonely places far away from the urban areas. These places are to unite with mother-Nature  to try to live the life of previous generations. In our dreams we turn more and more to the past. It seems to be very romantic and beautiful to us.
To be emaginative one needn't go somehwere. We can have dreams in our flats or houses. It all depends on a particular human being's nature. Only a small minority of people can think or act in an imaginative and extraordinary way. Most of us are resonable and predictable. I believe it's better to talk about space for emagination and dreams in our minds rather then on Earth. This space is getting smaller and smaller.
