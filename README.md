# SLAT7829 Text Analysis and Corpus Linguistics

**Course Description** The analysis of texts is undoubtedly a core aspect of many academic fields and important applications in education as well as the private sector. This course introduces students to the study of texts using computers, commonly called text analysis or corpus linguistics. Over the past decades, corpus linguistics has emerged both as a field in its own right but also as an important methodology across the language sciences including studies on language acquisition and learning, language variation and change as well as language use. As such, text analysis and corpus linguistics have helped to place linguistic theorizing on a sounder empirical footing by allowing researchers to explore massive amounts of textual data, be it learner essays, transcriptions of dinner table conversation, or historical documents. This course covers the fundamental concepts, origins, and methods of corpus linguistics and text analysis with a focus on a hands-on approach and using specific examples of how corpora can be used in applied linguistic research.
