Here we go!
It's Saturday night. You are sitting in front of your TV-set and you're watching a really great movie. You sit there with your beer in one hand and your chips in the other. You are just happy about what these private TV-stations show without charging you any money for it. Great!
Clint Eastwood points his gun at some poor guy's head and says: "Go ahead punk. Make my day." And then ... Pop goes the screen! Silly, multicolored beach balls bounce up and down, announcing that it's commercial-time now.
You just keep sitting there. Red-faced, with your mouth wide open and your hands forming to fists, crunching the chips you just wanted to eat.
Horrible? This is reality!
This is what happens on German couches every day. People are being annoyed in their spare-time.
Scandalous? Inhuman? Logic!
Private TV-channels don't charge fees. So they have to make their living in some other way. The above-mentioned story is a result of their financial politics.
The viewer doesn't pay, so the industry pays for having their advertisements placed exactly there, where most people are forced to see it.
So think about it: Either you pay fees to each and every TV-station or you get your movies for nothing except some interruptions that cost your nerves.
It's your choice!
