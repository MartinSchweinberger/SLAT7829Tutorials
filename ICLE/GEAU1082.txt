Last year, when I returned to Spain - as every summer, I had an interesting discussion with my friend Susan. She complained about the rowdy tourists that come to Spain to enjoy the sun and the wine and not only make every night a lot of noise because of their drunkness, but also leave the streets dirty. "I get sick when I see our nice streets full of broken bottels, cigarettes and a lot of other rubbish", said Susan. "The tourists don't want to know anything about our culture, our way of living, our typical meals. They complain if the meat is to greasy or the salad doesn't taste well, but they don't know anything about how spanish people cook," Susan continued complaining. I was sure that in some sense she was right, but I tried to explain to her, that the economy of Spain is based on tourism and that tourists often behave in a very strange way in other countries, because they feel a kind of liberty they can't feel in their own coutry because of the social pressure they have.
But Susan was not very convinced and told me a terrible story that happened only a few days ago: Some tourists were drunken in a bar and insulted a spanish man. The proud spanish man began a fight and finally the half bar was involved. A lot of them were hurted because they threw broken bottles through the air and finally ten persons had to be sent to hospital. One of them even died because he lost to much blood.
This was really a terrible story and I began to think that tourism wasn't good at all for Spain, although it was good for the economy!
