Watching the TV nowadays one has to put up with a strange phenomenon: Every time the movie you are watching drives at a climax, there is a break telling us what kind of shower gel, car or washing-up liquid our hero uses. Isn't that annoying? If TV commercials were informative I would not dare to say anything against them. But they are not. They are the most untruthful and therefore immoral pieces of film and the most arrogant, too, since they consider the watcher as stupid enough to buy the products offered in this way. "Ordinary" women, beautiful and long-legged, blue-eyed and with dazzling white teeths compete with the shapes and curves of a nicely washed, red sports car and reveal an erotic feeling that apparently every driver of this car should have.
Besides the fact that television commercials are not informative they can also not be avoided which is the meanest thing about them. You can escape posters, pictures and ads in the newspapers just by not looking at them.
But how about TV commercials that interrupt your favourite movie exactly when Ingrid Bergmann is about to leave Humphrey Bogart.
That is unforgivable. Even if you use the break to go to the fridge to get yourself a cool drink and hopefully no sweets, the very special atmosphere of this moment which means shiny eyes and handkerchief is lost forever. If you stay in front of the television you might be disturbed even more, since you are put in the irresistable mood of wanting and buying. Who can resist an extraordinarily good-looking woman telling you to buy a certain kind of pills to make your finger nails strong?
The innocent enjoyment of watching a movie is gone - with no possibility of return.
