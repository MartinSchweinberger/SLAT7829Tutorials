The number of cars on the streets is constantly raising. That fact brings up a topic of discussion and arguments. Is the car a bless to us or is the automobile man's worst friend?
It is a fact that it can be very helpful, it makes us much more independent and mobile than buses and trains, long distances can be covered in short times. But for a large number of people the car is not only a useful machine anymore. That can be seen with the raising member-numbers of for example Golf GTI- or Manta-clubs. They personify their cars by giving them names and they spend all week-end cleaning and repairing them. But what is much more dangerous: they identify themselves with their cars. The automobile often functions as a means of compensation for the lack of self-confidence. Sitting behing the wheel of a fast car makes them feel strong and superior and they try to get rid of their aggressions with speeding and illegal racing. They do not only bring themselves in great danger, but hundreds of innocent people as well. The numbers of fatal accident due to speeding is on an alarming high level.
I think there is a serious psychological problem behind it and that the attitude towards cars should be thought over and changed, not only because of the above listed reasons. There are other reasons for cutting down the number of cars and rides as well: During rush-hours traffic comes to a standstill. And last but not least the most important reason: We are polluting our enviroment. Soon, but propably too late, we have to realise that the enviroment does not need us, but we need the enviroment.
