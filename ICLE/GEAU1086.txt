With the rise of new private TV channels the viewer is obliged to stand more and more commercials. Not only that the channels which are runned by the state also have to increase their number of commercial spots in order to survive, but the private channels begin to feed us with such stupid programs called "durational commercial" as the "wheel of fortune" and of course fill in some half naked women praising the advantages of a new, revolutionary body lotion exactly at the most dramatic moment of a Hitchcock movie.
It doesn't matter if you're watching a really romantic movie with you're girl friend or a James Bond movie filled with suspense with some of you're friends, you can be sure that a bored housewife, who has just discovered that the new washing powder "whiter than white" keeps the original colour of your clothes, will appear on your screen just at the moment you started to kiss your girl-friend ... Good-bye romantic feelings and good-bye suspense.
I really don't care if it's the future german formula 1 champion who tells me which motor oil I should use to drive as fast as he does, or if it's a fat and well known actor explaining how easy it is to cook a good and nourrishing meal with the help of a new microwave, I just want to be left alone with all those commercials and being allowed to watch the movies without any break again.
Judged by the numbers of people who have the same opinion as me, there's only one solution: Either reducing, or even better, banning TV commercials!
