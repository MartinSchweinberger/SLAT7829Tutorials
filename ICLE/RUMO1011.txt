I guess that the modern society needs the prison system. Persons who have committed crimes of forethought must be received into prison. But I consider that the prison system has to be changed.
Prisoners who are convicted of grave crimes must be separated from prisoners who are convicted of less grave crimes. It will allow to save the latters from pernicious influence of habitual offenders and it will not allow to inveigle them into organized crime.
All prisoners must have opportunity to work or to learn.
All prisoners must have opportunity to connect with their relatives constantly by the use of letters and meeetings.
Discharged prisoner must be under state control and have the state supporting in the first period after his discharge.
Also I guess that no prison system can save a society from crimes since a prison system does not eliminate causes of crime.
