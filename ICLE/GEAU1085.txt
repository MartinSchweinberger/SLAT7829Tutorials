Darkness. Silence. The only sound you can hear is the soft breathing of the murderer waiting for his victim. A car passes by. The man hides his face in the collar of his coat. Silence. After a few seconds the deadly silence is destroyed by the sound of approaching steps. The murderer moves slowly. The steps are getting closer. He puts his hand into his pocket. Suddenly coloured plastic balls fall from above into the scene. An elegantly dressed, well groomed lady presents her new tooth paste. Full of anger I decide never to buy this tooth paste again nor the following shampoo for oily hair nor the innovative washing machine. I don't want to know how my teeth are getting as white as snow or how my hair is getting silky. The only thing I want to know is if the murderer manages to kill his victim. After five minutes the movie goes on. The story reaches its climax. The victim is shot. However I don't care anymore. All the tension has gone and I switch off the TV.
Watching a movie on RTL or Sat 1 means, that almost every romantic love scene or exiting fight is interrupted by a sequence of commercials. This method of trying to sell a product can ruin every movie. Added to this most of the German commercials are made for stupid housewives who are only interested in satisfying their husbands with a good meal and a tidy house. If a good movie is destroyed by such a bad commercial the effect on the TV watcher is not that he rushes into the next shop to buy the product but that he never touches it again. That is what the commercial agencies should think about. Maybe then they say too, that TV commercials should be banned.
