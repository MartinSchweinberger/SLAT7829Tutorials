In spite of the fact that the humanity has achieved greatest progress in developing science, creating new technologies , including military the limit of that progress is unseen. But in my opinion in the future science can lead to the dangerous prospects because some achievements can destroy the Earth and all people. And it is concerned with not only military achievements, so I suppose it's better to be more careful with the scientific works. One must remember fantastic novels, further development science and technology is not good at all. Of course, imagination flies and we can see a lot of thing in the real life about those everyone only could dream in the past. We should do our best that all new achievements were good to our common house - the Earth.
