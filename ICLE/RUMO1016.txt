I quite agree with that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers and there is no value in compulsory military service. This is due to the fact that armed forces are equipped now by complex and expensive materials which demand of special educated men. It's very difficult to train the specialist for several years when in compulsory military service. Thus it may be cheaper to operate the materials by one man that to change an operator every year. Besides permanent operators are very important to opearate such installations as nuclear power plants, missiles, rockets and other weapons and facilites which connect with elevated danger. Military experts regard that the compulsory service is necessary to have a permanent reserve. But evidently in the case of nuclear war everything will be settled in the first days and it won't be necessary in any reserves. When local conflicts, as the experience shows, there is not necessary to have reserves as well.
So I think that for prosperity and safety of my country is better to give up compulsory military service and to have a professional army.
