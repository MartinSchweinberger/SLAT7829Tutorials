State-of-the-art health technology works wonders in pushing the biological barriers forever forward. Youth worshippers are now offered a stunning variety of transplants, miraculous diets and treatments which can keep them up and about till their late 80s or 90s. Modern science has succeeded in artificially heading off senile decay, but has evidently failed to eliminate the process altogether. The descent from middle age to senility, however deferred, always takes place in the same sequence of steps.
The first stage of ageing is marked by a gradual, yet noticable, deterioration of physical fitness. It is at this stage, roughly between early 50s and 60s, when various aches and pains become a real nuisance. These are accompanied by a rapid decline in sexual activity; interest in sex diminishes accordingly. For the more vulnerable the process of ageing may stop at this stage, as people in this age bracket are especially prone to tragic heart and circulatory failures.
Next comes mental decay. A person entering this phase will often develop obsessive habits and ideas. Mental faculties, particularly memory, suffer greatly. While retaining of the remote past, an ageing person frequently has no recollection of some more recent events and is usually forgetful of daily trifles and routines.
Finally, an ageing person reaches a point where all the previous irreversible changes occur with double intensity, turning the person virtually into a passive vegetable. This, in fact, constitutes a preparatory stage for imminent death.
Senility and death are inevitable, which even most ardent health and youth freaks must grudgingly admit. The process of ageing may be either long and or sudden and dramatic; it may be delayed and nicely cushioned by modern medicine. However, it will always be part and parcel of human experience.
