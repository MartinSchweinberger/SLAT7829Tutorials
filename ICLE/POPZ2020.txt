Polish people have always looked up at Americans and admired their easy-going manner of calling colleagues or even supervisors by their first names. As a result, a number of attempts of adopting the American style of addressing others have been undertaken in the country and just as many have failed.
Using first names in a formal situation like one's place of work is, in fact, an entirely strange idea for most of the Poles. In Poland when people use their first names they have to be either of the same social status or very well acquainted with each other. Otherwise, there is always a danger that someone will feel offended or disrespected by this kind of intimacy.
Preserving the seemingly old-fashioned forms such as Mr or Mrs helps Polish people establish the necessary distance between each other. Moreover, Polish people are generally known to like to be referred to with all the due honorifics. When people call themselves by full names, in other words, they show respect but, what seems to be more important, they flatter and please each other.
It is hard to imagine then the proud and pompous Poles giving up the formalities which assure them so much pleasure and are so self-rewarding. They may envy the American culture its openness and unorthodoxy but, in fact, they prefer to keep to their own safe and unrevolutionary customs.
