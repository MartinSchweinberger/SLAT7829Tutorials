Among many institutions of every state the prison system as an organ of punishment takes not the last place. I believe it is impossible to imagine a state without prisons or any other organs of punishment. Those committed a crime should by all means be punished. It goes without saying.
But the main question is still being discussed. What missions should the prison system fulfill? The answer is doubtless: to recreate a person to return him to a normal life. But I dare say that no one prison system recreates men in full. On the contrary, it consumes a man, remakes him and breaks his soul. (God, bless me if I am wrong!)
Sure, to discuss a certain problem is rather difficult for  a person not concerned with it. The problem should be thoroughly observed in advance. By all means everyone has his own look at it but all opinions are amateur which can not pretend to be taken into consideration by specialists.
But I dare say some word on the problem. All the crimes committed should be punished. A deliberate crime should be punished tougher than an unintentional one. But those committing crimes twice or more must be isolated into prison for the long period. And those killed their victims cruely should be sentenced to death. An eye for an eye, despite Christ's words. Can the leopard change his spots?
The prison system should by all mean be flexible. Error is human. That taken a false step should be given a chance.
Sure, a short essay can not grasp the whole issue. And I do not try to.
At the top of all, I'd like to say: Give the devil his due.
