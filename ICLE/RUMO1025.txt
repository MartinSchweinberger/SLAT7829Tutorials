That goes without saying. Recruiting in the Russian Armed Forces in peacetime is based on voluntary enlistment and compulsory recruiting. But in time of war recruiting will be compulsory. The men selected for service are delivered to induction stations where they are examined and inducted. The few days spent at the reception station are filled with intelligence tests and tests to determine what skills are possessed by the treinee in order to assign him a military occupation speciality. But now many of recruits are excuse from duty because they have different illness. During spring recruitin only 67 per cent of recruits were drafted in Russia. Draft board excused from duty the others, because they were dipsomaniacs, drug addicts and invalids. But Army needs strong and healthy soldiers, because state gives them weapons  for protection of our country. Only voluntary enlistment allows the commanders to choose recruits which can take basic training and be qualified in any military speciality. But there are not enough men, who want to enlist, because soldiers are low-paid. There is shortage of inhabited places. The active service is too hard now. Many officers are resigning now. They don't want to be on duty 9-10 times a month. They don't want serve all day long without having a rest and without a holidays. That is why a morale in Army is rather low now. If our president wants to have a strong army, he must be very attentive to military's problems.
