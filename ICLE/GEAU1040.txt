Probably many people will not share this opinion but I have some reasons for this argument which cannot be denied even by the strongest car lovers.
Everybody knows that these wonderful aero-dynamic vehicles produce some of the worst things for the nature and, in consequence, for human life. The exhaust fumes of the cars are pure poison for the human organism and the nature. That means the more exhaust fumes, the more poisoned air, the more dying trees, the more ill people.
A further factor which is not less important are the accidents caused by cars and mostly by a certain type of car drivers. These stupid men which mean to be as brave as lions by driving like fools are a real pain in the neck, for the rest of the world. Thousands of people are daying every day on the streets, on the streets posessed by cars.
My last reason should interest all the lazy ones who drive by car, even if it is unnecessary. You just have to ask your neighbour and he will have to admit that he often uses the car just to buy some things in the supermarket round the corner. The worst I have seen in relation to this was a fat woman distributing newspapers in the morning. She drove to a house, jumped out, put the paper in the letter box and then went on to the next house, by car. Has she ever thought of her health, of the health of other people or even of the pollution she causes?
So, you lazy ones, stop the car and ride a bike!
The car is man's worst friend!
