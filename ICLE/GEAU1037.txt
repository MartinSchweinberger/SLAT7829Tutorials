No. It might be for cowards. But not for the brave. But, honestly, I firstly must explain the words I have used above. Cowardness in this sense does not mean the traditional cowardness. It means dogma, ideology. And ideology of any kind means the possession of the truth, its absolute possession. And it leads to inflexibility. Our world is too difficult to reduce it on simple ideals and values. A coward would be, for example, a soldier in an army that attacks a small and weak country. A heroe would stay at home, not fighting for his country. So far so good. But it would be of a similar cowardness to stand aside and watch this country and its people bleeding. Certainly, every individual has the right - which should be invulnerable - to refuse to carry a weapon. But it is often these ideologists of peace who denounce all the others that do not share their beliefs. In a sense that everyone who touches a weapon reduces himself to an animal. But this is - rubbish. To stand aside watching your brothers and sisters get nailed on a cross and not kicking the brains out of the torturers head - if there is no other solution - would mean a crime against humanity.
