In order to answer the question if there is any point in being ecology-conscious we have to think about the basic question: Do we need our environment? I personally think that environment is not necessary. Only those green cranks tell us fairy tales about its importants. Why do we need unpoluted rivers and oceans? We can buy our fish at the supermarket. Is there any point in thinking about garbage? Every child knows that we just have to put it in the dustbins and a few days later it is gone. Is there any reason for not cutting down a forest when a road is to be built? There would be no sense in buying a new Porsche, when there is no motorway to drive on. What does airpolution concern us? We need only oxygen to breath.
It is obvious that we do not need our environment. Therefore there is no point in being ecology-concious. Being ecology-conscious is pure madness. There is absolutely no point in separating garbage. This is just a waste of energy and time and on top it cost a lot of money. We could sent all our garbage to countries of the third world especially to the very poor countries those having almost nothing that they would have at least something of the industrial countries. There are also those lunatics fighting against nuclear power. Nuclear power is a way of saving the resources of wood and coal. Those green pessimists should think about that. Why should we reduce the use of cars? If we do not use our cars, there is no sense in having them. Besides that many people would loose their work if cars were not sold and built any more. What is the problem with poluted lakes? Everyone has a bathroom at home. We do not need lakes. And those who absolutely want to swim can go to Canada because there are lots of lakes that are still clean. I have my villa in the countryside with a big park. I do not need environment, therefore there is no point of being ecology-conscious.
