"Have you been yesterday on the report on the growth of the rubbish-mountains?"
"No, but how was it?"
"Quite interesting, the man said that everyman produces ... tons of rubbish each year!"
"Where was it?"
"In Augsburg."
"And how did you come there?"
"By car, why do you ask ...?"
Ecologists are better people! At least, they say. Conscious and sensitive enough they correct everything around them, calling me a "killer" when I visit them by car, telling me that my chain oil is poison for the drinking water when I visit them by bike. And, the best thing is, they tell (unasked) everybody how much they love nature and the panda-bears and the whales. Asked why they smoke they claim: "Everybody needs a sin!"
Another story: I am standing in a supermarket and want to buy milk. Which shall I take, the "returning" glass (-,50 Pf more expencive) or the "Grüner Punkt"-box, knowing that all green points land in the rubbish-ton. "Take the bottle", my friends say. "Take the box" my wallet means. What to do? Using my car (fast!) or going by bus (expencive and slow!), using soap or plastic-bottled lotions? Should I buy a new toothbrush or shall I still use the old one to avoid rubbish? (Exaggerated:) Shall I switch the light on or a candle?
My problem is: Where is the borderline between a "healthy" ecology-consciousnes and pure fanatism ending in madness?
I can only answer for myself: Taking about and telling others how to be "ecology-sensitive" has the same effect as wearing "Anti-Nuclear-Energy" buttons: Nothing happens.
When I find waste on the road, I normally pick it up, without talking! (Here I do, I need an argument!). Whenever it does not rain I go by bike, but I caannot avoid nor prevent the "Grüner Punkt" when I go shopping.
Being an "ecologist" costs much more, more money, more nervs, more time. But nevertheless they are better people! Whereelse should we start than with us?
