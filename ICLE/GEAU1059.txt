It is very difficult to find people and friends you really can rely on. You think you have nice neighbours like family "Müller" who lives on the first floor in our house because you always have a little chat on the steps when you meet. And whenever you need a little bit of salt or sugar or butter, you can ask Mrs Müller for it, she'll be glad to give it to you. But as soon as you show them your back they start talking about you. "Have you heard that Ms Leichs wants to buy a new car, soon?"; "Did you know that Stephanie's brother has a new girl friend?"; "I wonder whether Stephanie's dad earns enough money!" People who do things like that and talk badly about other people either have nothing else to do or are jealous of people who can be happy without making bad pictures of others. Dogs are completely different.
If you show them that you like them and give them the feeling that you're interested in them, they'll be your friend forever. They'll be around you when you're not in a good mood, they're glad when you go outside for a walk with them, they say hello with their tale, the eyes and their voice "wau, wau", and therefore show you how excited they are to see you. They won't lie to you, never will their shimmering eyes look at you with a flare of doubt in them. Even when you're in danger, someone wants to attack you while you're out for a walk with your dog, your dog will defend you and fight for you.
Not so with human beings. They change their opinions to often and always go with the flow. Once friend, forever friend is not true here because it's in the humans' nature to think badly of others.
