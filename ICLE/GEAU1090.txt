There's a lot of talk about television commercials among TV-spectators.
Especially private TV-channels are full of commercials during their programm. So many people complain about commercials disturbing a movie or an exciting tennis match.
I complain about the same thing and my opinion is that TV-commercials should be banned.
Last weekend I had to work the whole day, and in the evening - the weather was too bad to go outside - I intended to watch my favourite Western movie "play me the song of death" on a private channel. I was looking forward to this movie the whole day, and when it came to start, I was sitting in front of my TV-set with a cup of tea, my feet on a chair. The film started and after fifteen minutes there was the first break. I didn't care about it because my cup was empty and I could get some hot tea.
But after exactly another 15 minutes there was again a break. And then, after three other breaks with the same stupid commercials, the movie reached its most exciting scene. I was sitting in my chair trembling, with pain in my face and I waited for the murder of the hero as suddenly a nice young lady offered me the latest Ice-cream snack with a warm smiling. Another stupid commercial! I got very upset and angry and switched off my TV set. It is not great fun to watch a movie that is interrupted by commercials every 15 minutes. That's why I think television commercials should be banned.
