To spend a period of time abroad means to be confronted with a large number of difficulties in the beginning. The foreign language with its typical grammar, tense and aspect, word order, syntax and pronunciation and intonation causes a lot of problems and misunderstandings. Especially, if you stay at a family who does not prononce the words in this way you learned at school. This happened to me in 1987. In this year, in August, I stayed in Margate for three weaks at a family. The housewife tried to pronounce the words as clearly as possible, but her husband, born in London did not. He talked Cockney English, the terrible accent which is rearly typical for Londoners. This caused great anger, problems and misunderstandings to me because at school I had been taught original Oxford English!! My teacher had spoken very slowly and loudly, too. But this English man did not thought of this. This meant that there was no chance for him and me to have a great talk or discussion. But there were some good discussions with the woman and both, she and I, enjoyed them. I have to admitt that this didn't happen in the beginning of my holiday - because of the initial difficulties with the foreign language I mentioned before - but after the first week I was more self-confident and this meant that I was able to discuss with a native English person! At this moment I was very, very proud because I had stand the initial difficulties and I thought: it was a good idea to spend a period of time abroad.
