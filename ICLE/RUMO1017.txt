Beginning with the times of Victor Hugo, ecological situation have been grossly changed. The quantity of plants and factories has been enhanced, urbanisation has been increased as well. There have been a lot of other factors, which inflience ecology very badly. The factors pose a grave threat to nature and humantiy. They are global warming, deforestation, ozone deflection, environment pollution. Each of the factors is very serious. Global warming can lead to melting glaciers of the antarctic region, raising sea-level, submerging a great number of vital areas. Deforestation leads to shortage of oxygen and all subsequences connected with it. Ozone deflection leads to enhancing the number of dangerous desease. Environment pollution is one of the grave problems, which should be solved the sooner the better. It leads to dying out a lot of species of animals, fishes, plants. As a whole any of the problems threats to the existing of humanity but taking together they pose such a threat, which humanity has never faced before.
But humanity begins to recognize the danger and undertake a number of measures to improve the situation. There are the organization to protect nature, such as "Green Peace" and so on. Severe punishments are provided for environment pollution, some governments ban using of chemicals, protect whole zones et cetera. The special step to protect nature is the creation of nature reserves and national parks, which help to conserve animals, plants, fishes and so on. Thus I think humanity is clever enough and thanks to the efforts of many countries the problems will be solved by using the latest achievements of science and technology.
