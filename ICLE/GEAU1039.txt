In our days when everyone speaks of pollution and environment the function of the car is discussed by old people as well as by youngsters. Nearly everyone has got his own car and almost nobody could think of his life without his own car in the garage. On the one hand in some cases the car is a really useful thing when you think of transporting things from one place to another, although sometimes it would also be possible to go by feet or to go by bike. People are too much accustomed to the car. While they think about messures to protect the environment they use their car without thinking of the consequences. Admittedly, the car is a very comfortable thing but wouldn't it be also possible to go by train or by bus in some cases? Or wouldn't it be possible to have only one car in the family? People today are very lazy; they are always pressed for time so that they are obliged to have their own car. While the head of the family goes to work by car the housewife needs her own car to bring her children to the kindergarden, to school or to the piano lessons. So, why should they sell one of their cars?
It is also important for people to be independent. The car is a useful thing to realize their independence. Nobody wants to wait for the train or the bus for more than five minutes.
So, all in all the car is man's worst friend.
