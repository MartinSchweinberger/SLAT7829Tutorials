Today I'd like to watch a good film on RTL. I take a look into the newspaper because I've forgotten it's starting point - it's a quarter past eight and lasts till - eleven o'clock?! Did they lengthen this film, I wonder.
After a while of watching I begin to understand, why it'll last till eleven o'clock - almost evry 12 minutes they are broadcasting advertisments, simply by interrupting the film.
Some of them are quiete amusing but most of them are that boring and stupid that I switch over to another program.
I've really no interest in watching almost naked women, who are in love with their soap, the unbelievable exagerations of washing-powder commercials, that wash "whiter than white", the dog, that is only happy, when he is fed with a special kind of dog food.
Dracula is drinking red orange juice and even the devil is very fond of buttermilk.
The thing that annoys me most is the effect on my four-year-old daughter. She really believes every single word that is promised in these commercials. "Mummy", you must by this toothpaste, the teeth will get much more whiter! Mummy, may I have this chocolate bar - it's the favourite one of all children in the telly!"
Nobody should have the right to influence the opinions of people in such a hypnotizing manner.
It was proved that TV commercials have a large impact on our subconciousness and that we can easily be brought to by things by such psychological tricks.
George Orwells utopia "1984" with its main theme of controlling thoughts doesn't seem to be that unbelievable in this context.
Therefore should TV commercials be banned.
