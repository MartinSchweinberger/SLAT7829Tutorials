<ICLE-GE-AUG-0016.1>

When I entered the university this morning a member of the green movement handed me a paper where this sentence was printed im Capital letters forming the headline.
Every student was asked to use public transportation or bikes to come to the lectures and should avoid using a car. I glanced through this small leaflet and went back to the red haired girl, wearing obviously only hand made knitted or woollen clothes from her colourful flowered skirt to the heavy pullover made out of Shetland wool.
I tapped her on the shoulder and when she turned around with a friendly smile it was much easier for me to ask for further information. I told her I'd heard about a project in Erlangen where it was possible to get a students' bus ticket for the duration of one term for only 40 Marks. It enabled the students to use the public transportation to solve several problems - the overcrowded streets with all their noise and smog and pollution would become much more friendly, quieter and worth living on for many people. The girl showed me a list of 623 signatures from inhabitants of the areas next to the university which complained about the nuisance cars made. They didn't dare to let their children play on the streets, there had been already 5 severe accidents this year, and it seemed impossible for the mothers to go for a walk with their children, even if they were still in a pram: the pavement was crammed with cars parked wildly all over the place.
I promised to use public transportation facilities in the future and signed on the list to help these people get their right.
