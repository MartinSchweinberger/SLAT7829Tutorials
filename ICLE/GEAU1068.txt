During the last years it has become increasingly difficult for foreigners in Germany. Hatered towards foreigners has grown like a contagious disease. I recall a conversation I overheard between two old German ladies in a bus. They were speaking about foreigners and mentioned every typical cliché Germans (some - most?) have about these people. They were saying that all smell bad and that they should get a job, but in the next minute were talking about the foreigners, that take the jobs (in their eyes) ment for Germans and that noone should be surprised if young Germans react the way they did in Mölln. But they did admit that killing people was not the solution either. The conversation went on like this for a while; I couldn't believe what my ears were hearing.
This is only one example, but I believe (unfortunately) many Germans share these old ladies point of view. But we should not forget the thousands of Germans that demonstrated for foreigners in cities like Munich or Hamburg. I, as a foreigner, believe it will be difficult for people from other countries and cultures to live in Germany, since Germans somehow are afraid of foreigners. (Mostly because of lack of knowledge about them). Although I hope that the thousands of people who demonstrated will try to make a difference in Germany. Maybe some day hatred towards foreigners can be kicked like a bad habit; because it should not matter if your skin is yellow or red, black or white anywhere in the world.
