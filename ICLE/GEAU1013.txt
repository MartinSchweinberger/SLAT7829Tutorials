Imagine endless alleys of huge trees, where you can have a break in the shade after a long and busy shopping day. Promenade along splendid arrays of colourful flowers straight to a big market square, where's always a great hustle and bustle especially on sundays. Puffers are praising all kinds of vegetables and fruits, meat, fish and cheese and the market fountain in the middle offers clear cool water for anyone's tired feet or thursty mouth. Take a deep breath. The air is full of pure "parfume", no smell of exhaust gases anywhere. Nobody even knows anymore what smog means. Riding a bike is no longer a dangerous slalom through stinking and roaring mountains of sheet metal but simply a great pleasure. Absolutely laden tramways toddle through the lanes ringing not because of cars standing on the rails but because of children hopping there. No one is aggressive because no one has to waste his time in horrible traffic jams.
According to the latest opinion polls in Munich the majority of the population is in favour for a large pedestrian zone in the middle of the city. The pollution would decline and the quality of living would certainly increase. Thinking of us and of our children we should ban cars at least in the cities as soon as possible.
