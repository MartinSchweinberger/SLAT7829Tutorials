In inner-cities cars diminuish the quality of living. In Landsberg the town-council and the association of shop-owners have been arguing about keeping out the cars of the town centre for years. At Christmas the mayor ordered to close down the Ludwigsstraﬂe, in order to transform it into a pedestrian zone. Now one is breathing fresh air instead of exhaust fumes. Hooting cars and roaring busses are replaced by buckets filled with gloriously colourful flowers. Pedestrians are no longer chased by aggressive drivers whose outbursts of rage turned their faces as red as a beetroot. The inhabitants may open their windows again without being afraid of dying of lung-cancer. The cosy atmosphere invites you to stroll from shop to shop and have a cup of coffee afterwards, sitting on the former pavement which before was the last refuge for frightened and trembling pedestrians.
But also in the country-side cars are dangerous and sometimes unnecessary. My 4-year old cousin was badly injured while playing in front of his parents' house in our village. The conductor of a moving van drove too fast and lost control over his transporter. Black ice made his vehicle slip into my uncle's garden and hurt my beloved Jimmy. Another cousin of mine was innocently killed in a car accident, just because two young fellows had played cats and dogs by car.
It is not sufficient to claim that cars ought to be banned without offering an alternative. But they could often be substituted by public means of transport.
