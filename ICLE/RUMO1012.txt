I guess that university education is most fundamental one. When students graduate from a university they maybe are not prepared to solve the certain problem which may be raised unexpectedly by life reality. But it is an advantage of university graduates. Their volume of knowledge allows them to solve any problems in diferent fields of human activities. We must not forget that all practical results in our life depend on theoretical bases. Universities train research workers in humanities and the sceinces. And the progress of our world is based on the fundamental sciences. They give us ways of the best approach to the development of new technology.
