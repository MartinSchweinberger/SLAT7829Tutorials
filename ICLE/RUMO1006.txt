All my ideas about the prison finish in the frame of my bitter experience when I was at a guard-house. I'm sure that if all our prisons worked in the same way , criminality would fall up to 10% of the modern level. We were sleeping for 5-6 hours. We hadn't any opportunity to cover with a great coat. It was very cold in the cell. We ate bread and gruel. We didn't  see butter, meat, fish and sugar. There were only two spoons for forty men. We ate by hands. We worked all day time and hadn't free time for rest. It was winter and we were very cold. A half of us hadn't even gloves in spite of frost. I had been there for 5 days. And though the attitude to us was very awful I'm sure that everything was right. Everybody must pay for his sins. The more you have sins, the more strict punishment must be for you.
In this country criminals are the most respected part of the society. The people, which likes thieves' cant and speak in thieves'slang, must be ready to live in the country with total criminality. The word "to steal" doesn't mean anythihg bad. Many people consider a thief to be a lucky adroit man. Criminals kill more and more, but they are punished less and less. But I consider that a thief must be at a prison.
