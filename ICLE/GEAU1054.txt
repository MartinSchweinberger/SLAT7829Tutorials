<ICLE-GE-AUG-0054.1>

When I first came to Augsburg I got the impression of a small somehow sleepy, boring town with some nice buildings and inhabitants whose accent is horrible. But today I know that Augsburg can be very exciting, you only have to find out what to do for it. Last summer I bought some tickets for the "La Piazza"-Festival which takes place every year in July for about 1 week. I got tickets for a group called "Black Voices": 5 black women singing a capella music. As it was my first visit to the festival and to a concert of "Black Voices" as well I didn't expect very much - what can a boring town like Augsburg offer me!? I tried to spot a free chair somewhere in the tent that was crowded with people and waited for the beginning of the concert always keeping the idea of "Augsburg as a cultural nowhere" in my mind. Then the singers started their concert and after a few minutes I had forgotten where I was. They had beautiful voices, contraltos that made my skin raise up to goose-flesh, they sang songs of love, songs from Africa and I wished they would never stop to sing - unfortunately they did; the concert was over but it had caused a strong feeling of excitement in me. So every town, even Augsburg can offer excitement - I only had to open my mind for it.
