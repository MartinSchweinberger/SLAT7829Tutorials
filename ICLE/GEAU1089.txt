Watching TV today one gets the impression that advertisement is the leading entertainment section on private TV channels. Not only that they interrupt each film at the peak of tension at least for four or five times but waste the money the channel earns through commercials for things like reality TV or sex films. In the case of RTL or SAT1 both directors try to fight the other one with more dramatic discussion circles, popular sport events or cheap sex films. Tennis had developed to one of the most famous and therefore endlessly broadcasted sport in Germany but TV commercials destroy the joy of supporting the players feverishly. Important tournaments such as Wimbledon could be seen the whole fortnight long. But every time when Boris Becker or Steffi Graf are allowed to sit down after two games one has to watch either beer drinking male managers, female housewives that smile charmingly due to their revolutionary new washing powder or singing monkeys that dream to have the tremendous Japanese car, the new wonder of technical possibilities. Of course, there are some commercials that make you laugh but most of the time they are that boring that I start yawning or leave the room to get something to drink or eat. The millions of money that are wasted for advertisement on TV could be investigated into research work f.i. how to reduce the exhaust fumes of cars, to save the rain forest or to avoid climate catastrophies through air pollution. I do not believe that companies gain back the money they spent for TV commercials due to consumers that are attracted to a product by the means of advertising. The grown up citizen of Germany should have the choice to have some TV channels that do not make fun of them with hours of ads.
Let us free ourself from ridiculous spots by avoiding watching TV at all!
