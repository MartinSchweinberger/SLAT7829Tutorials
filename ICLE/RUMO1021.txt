The nature of the modern society is not to be permissive. There are people who represent threat for the others. They develope criminal tendencies, some of them commit crimes more than once. There's no doubts such criminals ought to be isolated from the society. Honest people are not to be intimidated. Society should stand to the crime wave. And criminals are supposed to feel fear that they will be punished for their activities against law. That is the prison system for. Besides it serves to correct imprisoned people. to make them less agressive, to change their views, thoughts, intentions to the best.
On the other hand, it's horrible that prisoners are deprived of freedom. Some of the criminals commits their crimes under certain circumstances, not on purpose, not deliberately. The punishment seems to be exobitant. So they have to spend years of sufffering in prison. To tell the truth, time spend in jail often changes prisoners to the worst. Some of them leave the jail having learned specific criminal's skills and tricks they hadn't had before. They are sometimes ready for new crimes.
Being in jail is especially harmful for teenagers.
Young criminals have to get to know the bad side of a life in their youths. It's awful to spend your best years in prison. Freedom is the most essential need of a human being. Maybe, the prison system doesn't improve people, but makes them worse.  It might even bring about new, more dangerous criminals having been grown up in jail.
What ought to be done to keep the crime wave in check? Perhaps the problem can be solved by creating conditions when committing crimes becomes unprofitable. A new world should be built, where people will realize that lots of ways lead to well-being and there's no need to break laws to reach that goal.
