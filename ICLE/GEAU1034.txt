The ubiquitous "Green Point" seems to mark a new era, it is supposed to be the logo for the environment-friendly attitude of us Germans. True, there is such an attitude nowadays, but what exactly does the term "ecology-conscious" mean to us?
We collect paper, tin foil, yoghurt cups and never seem to get tired of carrying them to the containers. Being good citizens, we leave the cardboard wrapping of our tooth-paste in the supermarket. We happily buy dish washing liquids with the term "biologically degradable" printed on the package.
But are these really the things that make the difference? How many people take the bus or the bike instead of the car? Not that many, it seems - just take a look at Friedberger Straﬂe at eight in the morning.
One suspects that we are ecology conscious only to the point where our neighbours can say "Oh, they care for our environment, they collect their newspapers and their second car has got Kat, too!"
But even so it is good that there are tendencies towards saving the environment, we just have to realize that we cannot believe everything industry and politicians tell us. How do we now in how far our dish washing liquid really is degradable? And can we be sure that the cashier lady at the supermarket does not just take the collected cardboard boxes etc. and throws them in the garbage can at the end of the day?
We will have to think for ourselves if we want things to change: we could boycot products with too much wrapping, gather information about which products are environmentally harmless and which of them are not and much more.
If we do this, then there certainly is a point in being ecology conscious, because then we set an example for industry and politicians and make them change their ways.
