There is nothing in the world to be more useful and at the same time useless as the automobile.
There is no better way of moving from here to there comfortable than sitting in your car, starting the engine and there you are.
The trouble starts when you reach the place you wanted to go. You have to find a place where you can leave your vehicle and nowadays that's not so easy as it used to be. Everyone has a car today, everyone uses it as often as possible and everyone tries to find a free spot at the parking area. This search has become some kind of adventure or rather a bit of a war. It's not unusual that carholders begin to argue about who has the right to leave his car there. Once I saw a man hurrying to the last free spot. As he wanted to get out a big dog approached and barked terribly. After a while he noticed that he would have no chance to leave his car without being killed he decided to go elsewhere. As soon as he was out of sight an elderly woman occupied this holy piece of earth and it turned out that the dog belonged to her.
But this is not the only problem in connection with cars. As they are so comfortable, that once you have a car, you want to keep it at any price. You get addicted. You spend most of your money on the car. You have to pay for the insurance; you have to pay tax and last but not least you have to pay for petrol. Once your car is wrecked you have to buy a new one untill you have spent everything and nothing left. Then you have to eat junkfood at Mc Donalds instead of having something proper to eat. Your clothes are worn down to rags and finally you die. Then you go to the cymmetery but at least you are going there by car.
