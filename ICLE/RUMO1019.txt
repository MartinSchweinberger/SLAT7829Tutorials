Education in general universities is academic. Most of the subjects are theoretical. Some students forget them immediatly after exams forever. These disciplines are seemed to be never used in practical life. Some people think it is just an awful waste of time. Studying theoretical subjects takes a few years but seems to be useless.
But the matter is not so simple. A scientist is considered to be a well-educated person with a broad world outlook. To become a real scientist one has to study a lot of subject to understand many facts and predict forthgoing developments. On only that condition a student or a post-graduate student can become an authority on a particular subject. Apart from that applied sciences based on theoretical sciences are of great practical value. A lot of major discoveries are made on the junction of interconnected sciences. A scientist who strives for great discoveries has to know a lot in neighbouring fields of knowledge.
Moreover theoretical knowledge and theoretical sciences are of great practical value themselves. Discoveries made in theoretical sciences bring a lot of good to the people.
A lot of attention is paid to theoretical subjects. Studies at every higher educational establishment start with compulsory theoretical disciplines.
The states that give less money for theoretical sciences are most likely lagging behind in scientific achievements. We go to practice through theory.
