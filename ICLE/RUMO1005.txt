Prisons are not the better place for correct behaviour. Hard condtions in prisons make it difficult to change criminals. In this country there are no good conveniences for imprisonment. Criminals are together in their prisons and train newcomers bad things. In Western countries prison conditions are more better than in Russia, and this fact helps to change criminals in better way of life. Western criminals have possibilities to watch TV-set,listen to the radio, watch video and films, to meet with their lovers and families and to do their hobbies. They can read books, increase their education level, so they become more educative people.
The more bad conditions in prisons, the worse become criminals. We must remember it. But the most important thing is to prevent committing a crime.
