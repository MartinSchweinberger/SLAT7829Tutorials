Experience of may countries in the world shows that a professional army is preferable than that with compulsory military service. If the army is professional, it consists of servicemen and servicewomen who decided to devote their life to military career. Thereby they join the army voluntarely. Professional soldiers do their best to perform their duty properly. They try to make progress to be promoted to higher ranks or positions. It's only natural. Usually professional military servicemen are well paid. Their social and living conditions are perfect. They don't have to worry about earning their living as they have everything necessary. In professional armies people are encouraged to continue their education. The higher education, the more skillful a serviceman is. So he may get higher position.
On the other hand, compulsory military service means that some people who do not want to serve are forced to join the army under the law. These people are reluctant to perform the duty. Some of them try to avoid draft. Others do nothing serving in the army. They just kill the time till their service is over. It is especially  true when the soldier's sellary is low, when they are poorly-trained and equipped. If that's the way things are, the  soldiers are really looking forward to leaving the army. Some of them can become the dezerters.
But in some cases a country has to establish a compulsory military service. Like for instance, it is necessary in time of war or national emergency. The soldiers are needed to protect the country against invaders, to defend it sovereignty.
In general, other thins being equal, professional soldiers ar better than those of the compulsory military service army.
