The emancipated woman is more alive than ever before! Superficially it may look the other way, because many women seem to prefer the good old macho to the softie of the eighties. But that doesn't indicate the women's weakening. They simply got sick of the cute, friendly and boring houseman. They want a real man. He has got to ride a motorbike, he has got to drink beer, he is not allowed to shave too often and he must not dare to tell her he was too tired to make love. Women accept all the chauvinist habits of the men, but in a different way than in those days of the sixties. Nowadays' women have grown strong themselves and they clearly see the reasons for the men's behaviour. If he is drunk and strikes her, she strikes back and gets pissed herself. She doesn't take over his characteristics, she is no copy of the macho. But she's free and strong enough to deal with him in her own new way.
The woman of the nineties still wants to have children. But she is not ready to lay aside her job, her friends and her hobbies for the family's sake. She demands a fair participation from the man, a kind of private job-sharing. She insists on her partner helping her. He has got to wash up the dishes after dinner, to clean the rooms, to feed the baby, to wash it and to hum it to sleep - at least a few times a week. In return for that she may wash the car or repair a broken chair, things the man would normally do in his spare time. If he agrees to change roles for at least a few hours a day, she will let him have his beer, his beard and his bad behaviour, for she'll be happier with him than with a softie who takes care of everything 24 hours a day and who would bore her to death.
The emancipated woman is more alive than ever before. She likes the good old macho who brings tension into their relationship. And she loves the good old macho when she manages to get him clean the baby's behind.
