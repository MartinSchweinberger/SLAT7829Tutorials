In today's society nearly every family owns at least two cars. Especially among young people it has become very fashionable to buy a car at the age of eighteen.

Definetely, the busy, hectic, nervous financial salesman, who is both a successful businessman and a loving and caring father of two children, is in need of having a sleek, darkgreen, sportive BMW with leathered seats. But one mustn't forget the full-time job of a house-wife, who has an appointment at the hairdresser, the doctor and the grocery store at the same time - she too must be able to jump into her flashy, red "Ford Fiesta" and drive into town at 80 km/h. Here, the question arises, if it is really a necessity to possess a car. There are many reasons which speak against this motorized, mobile, metall cube on four wheels.
For one thing, cities are crammed with billions of them causing traffic jams accompanied by honking horns, smelly, steaming, smoggy air, and frustrated, unfriendly, frowned faces. Then, let us think of the terrible, terrorizing car accidents on our crowded streets which not only cost a mountain of money but also lots of lives. A car is also a very expensive matter considering the fuel prices which seem to zoom up every week or two. But one of the most important facts which speak against this vast-spread vehicle is the destruction of our environment. Forests, trees, flowers and especially the air have to carry a heavy burden on their weak shoulders. People should stop driving and start thinking!
