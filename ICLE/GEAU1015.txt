I'm sure that everybody had once thought: "Cars ought to be banned" I also had such an experience. It was in the summer of 1990. I and a friend of mine were spending some days in Berlin. Our day there were filled with visiting museums, sight-seeing, round-trips, going shopping ... We had a whole lot to do. We didn't even notice the time passing. At one evening, when I was washing me thoroughly I looked in the mirror. When I looked closer at my face, I almost had to cry.
My face was covered with pimples, my nostrils were grey and my ears were black - covered with dirt. "What's that! Why am I so dirty!" I shouted. My friend immediatelly came into the bathroom. She only began to laugh and answered: - "That's the soot of the cars!"
At the next day, I noticed this huge mass of cars pushing through the streets of Berlin, standing and waiting at traffic-lights and always spitting out their soot for the first time. "What a lot of cars! Why do cars exist? Why don't the people go by bus, by train or by underground!" I was furious, because I imagined my bad skin. "Cars ought to be banned!".
It was also the first time, I had a closer look at the big houses, that surround the alleys of Berlin. It was shocking. The walls were not white anymore. I'm sure they once had been painted white, but now they're grey and soot-blackened. The roofs had no red tiles. They were black as well. "The window-frames must probably be painted each year" I thought. I didn't feel well, after noticing what the soot of the cars destroy. I really felt sick and wasn't able to spend more time in this polluted air.
I could only say: "Let's go home, Sally!"
