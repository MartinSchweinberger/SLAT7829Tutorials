When an eager and innocent adolescent starts to study languages, which is the most frequent piece of advice he is given? Go and study at least half a year abroad, for this is the best way to learn a foreign language.
And this keen young man or woman starts to study. Step by step he looses (at least a part of) his ideals concerning university, but the prospect of going abroad gives him a glint of hope. It is very difficult to achieve good qualifications and to maintain his zeal in overfilled classrooms, agglomerated libraries with missing books and with stressed teachers. The same thing with scholarships and grants. But after having applied for several grants and scholarships, he at last gets one.
Now the first doubts come: how will it be? Will his friends wait for him?
After having arranged the finances, all the papers and the accomodation for abroad the departure hour comes. Sad parents, teasing sisters and brothers tell him farewell, he must promise to write and phone. The last days spent with friends pass quickly, and all of a sudden the x-day arrives. Last hugs and kisses at the airport, and then alone in the plane and in a few hours away from home.
The first time is terrible, but beautiful too. So much new happening around him, so many new aquaintances so that he has hardly time to think about his own problems and sorrows.
Time passes so quickly, friends from home visit him, the new people, the country, the new language this are all things he will like to be reminded of.
