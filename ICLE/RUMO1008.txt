I suppose that theory and practice are mutual connected. Without practice there is no theory and vice versa. This statement is old as our world. Of course a lot of in studying depends on fuculty. If the teacher gives a lecture or the other class on the high level, he can makes his students to be interested in his subject. It makes a lot of good.
Undoubtedly a lof of depends on a student. If he is lazy he will be in plight after from graduation his higher school. Naturally real life is other thing. Theory is always checked by practice. But if a student worked hard at his institutes it will be easier to overcome difficulties at an enterprise or a factory. So university degrees are rather important in my opinion. Without them it would be impossible to work. Moreover every worker must filled his head with knowledge, long for new level of mentality because nobody will respect a specialist without a solid luggage of knowledge. And I suppose there is nothing afraid of if in the beginning something will be wrong. Experience comes with time's flowing. So in my my opinion university degrees are rather necessary for everyone who wants to achieve a certain success in this world.
