I think that all armies that consist of entirely of professional soldiers are efficient only in small, local operations. These armies have not well-trained reserves. So it means that those armies cannot conduct large-scale operations in large theatres of war for a long period of time. These troops are good only for unexpected local operations. On the other hand, they have a well-trained personnel which very well knows its weapons and equipment.
Most countries which have no natural obstacles on their boundouries must have well-trained reserves as well as well-trained and equipped regular forces. It is possible only when they have armies which not only consist of professional soldiers, but when they also have drafted personnel. Combined system of military service is widely spread now in most countries. At the same time many countries have armies which consist only of drafted personnel. In this case the term of service should be as long as it is necessary for good-training of this personnel. This type of military service helps to have well-trained reserves as well as well-trained regular forces. It enables them to conduct large-scale long-term operations. Besides that when every man must serve in the army tensions among the population about the questions of the draft are removed.
And, by the way, every army consisting entirely of professional soldiers required a lot of money. It is very expensive type of Armed forces, it is a very expensive for taxpayers.
