<ICLE-GE-AUG-0057.1>

I was sitting with some friends in a pub in Augsburg. One of them had spent a week on a holiday trip for skiing in Austria with other people.
He said it was quite good but some of the people were not his cup of tea. In the morning they needed a lot of time to wake up. In the bath someone spent just five minutes another one more than half an hour. Breakfast was of always changing quality. Coffee was sometimes prepared, sometimes not. Tea had the most interesting colours and mostly a bad taste. The bread was fresh at the beginning of the week. At the end no more. Butter went out in the course of the week and new one not bought. Washing up was a chaos till it was properly organised. The same who prepared the breakfast had to do the washing up.
An experienced ski-driver did not seemed to be there except himself. The skis of the others were not prepared. He had to wax them. Tell them which were the proper shoes. Show them a place to fit their abilities. Giving instructions how to use the ski lift and what you have to do for getting a "ski-passport". How to come up again when you were fallen in the snow without having to make your skis off. During skiing one should not drink "Jägertee", at least not to much. The alcohol contained in it might deteriorate your abilities when skiing. During lunch-time one should not eat to heavy and to much food. Unless you don't want to spent the afternoon with skiing.
