"The car is man's worst friend." I think the very first reaction of everybody in our high-industrialized, polluted world will be one of consent. But on the other hand there are some good arguments for the opposite statement.
Everyone, living in the country will agree, that it is almost impossible to reach university by bus or other public means of transportation if he/she does not like to get up at half past four in the morning and is fit to go some 7 km by bike before entering the bus.
But there are much more arguments that inspire people to become car-opponents.
The pungent stench of the exhaust fumes are not only unpleasant to people's noses, they are undeniably very harmful for both people and their environment. Exhaust fumes, and therefore cars are, amongst other points, responsible for the acid rain, that harms and destroys firs and oaks, roses and daisies.
The poisonous gases, produced by cars and emerging (?) into the atmosphere causes warnings from both environmentalist and scientists, to avoid the sunlight, for this may cause cancer.
But there is a further point: going by car means traffic congestions and that means hectic: People shout and scream in their little iron-boxes like fierce animals - only because that one in front of them does not go forward the next two metres with loudly squeeling wheels.
Moreover people harm not only their mental but only their physical well-being.
Going by car hinders them from taking any notice of whistling birds or the smell of fresh, clean air, while biking through the park.
