It's not easy to talk about prison system. It goes withous saying that prison system, in my opinion, has never changed a man in better way of leading life. I've got some friends of mine who served in this system. They often talked about bad remembering their service. First of all cruelty in relations between both among prisoners and among jail personnel and prisoners. I know some people who were in the jail. Their stories about prisoner system are terrible. If you are a strong man you can overcome the difficulty of imprisonment because there are wolf laws. In this system only strength is respected, nothing more, only strength.
It is known that there is a certain gradation among prisoners. Official power is in prison authorities' hands but actually so-called "pahans" (leaders of prisoners) make governing. Human dignity is violated. Sometimes even human dignity is violated by prison authorities. Of course, prison system is necessary, evil must be punished. At the present time as far as I know most of prisons are overcrowded, jailmen have nothing to do because a lot of enterprises are closed which were connected with the jails in economic aspect previosly. Also a lot of prison personnel leave this service because of small salary, first of all. As far as read and saw in Western films Western prison system is more democratic in all aspects. Russian prison system, it goes without saying, is needed in improvement, in more civilized conditions.
