Obviously everyone is familiar with the horrible pictures of crying mothers who lost their men and children in the second world-war. But recently there have been, and there are still fierce battles, like in Iraq or in the former Yugoslavia.
However, no war is the same, as they have all different causes and objectives. So, one should ask himself the question, whether a war is justified or whether peace is a good thing at any price. There is no doubt, a war with all its consequences, has to be in any cases only the final and last solution of problems. But nobody can deny that a war is sometimes the most effective solution, when other methods like economic sanctions are useless.
What would have been, when the gulf-war had not took place, and when peace in the South-East had been maintained at any price?
The answer is more than evident, Saddam Hussein would now, after the decline of the Sovjet Union, be the second super power after the United States. He would control under his regime a great part of the oil resources, he would terrorize his arabic neighbour countries with imperialistic politics, and he would frighten the whole world by developping nuclear weapons.
I'm convinced that all this power in the hand of a terrorist is not wanted by anyone, so that I can clearly say that in this case peace at any price would have been foolish, because Saddam would have began a much more violent war by himself, in order to increase his political power.
But now, after the gulf-war, his most dangerous weapons are destroyed, and he has to show all his nuclear and chemical weapon plans, so that any further agressions can be excluded. The gulf-war preserved the world from a more violent and terrible war, caused by Saddam Hussein.
