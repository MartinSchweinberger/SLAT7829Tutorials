Every German knows that English cooking is dreadful. No matter what experiences other people made, one sticks to this prejudice like a bur to one's skirt.
When I first visited my pen-friend in Great Britain, I was terribly afraid of what I would get to eat. Too many horror stories had been spread by people whom you would have thought reliable. I hate fish and therefore I was afraid to get fish and chips. And I hate peas and that is, so I was told, the most frequent dish you get.
On the first evening, I was invited to a restaurant and I choose a pizza. My experience told me that I needn't be afraid of fish and peas in this case. How wrong I was! The melted cheese of my dish was decorated with many little green spots - peas. Stoically I ate them and endured the taste in my mouth. Afterwards I told my pen-friend about those things I didn't like at all, and she promised that I wouldn't get peas and fish during the following two weeks. After the first week, I was perfectly raptured by the lovely sweet taste of a trifle and the salty-sour taste of salt-and-vinegar crisps. I was really excited until my pen-friend declared that she would serve me a delicious dish which she was sure I would like: toad-in-the-hole. I didn't know until then that I don't like toads eighter. I wished I had never entered that country and I wished many other things as well. When I finally was served that unavoidable dish, I noticed with relief that it was sausages baked in a mixture of eggs, milk and flour. My pen-friend told me afterwards that every Englishman knows how keen Germans are on sausages and she wanted to surprise me with this traditional British dish.
Not even today I can say that I am sure British cooking is not dreadful. If it is not the taste of the dishes that is dreadful, it seems to be at least their names.
