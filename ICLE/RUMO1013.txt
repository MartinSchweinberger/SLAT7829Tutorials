I think that Nature suffers nowadays more than in the 19th century. Air, water, soil, climate and living things are the indissoluble parts of the whole. When we allow to pollute million tons of industrial wastes into air, water and soil we allow to change climate and finally living creatures. We ourselves kill the Earth and insects, fishs, birds animals and people on it. Moreover we are destroying the ozone layer by using aerosols and it is changing climate and causing cancer diseases.
We ourselves ought to stop industrial pollutions, using aerosols and thoughtless felling.
If we purify rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, if we plant and care trees, if we purify air, we save our planet and humanity on it.
