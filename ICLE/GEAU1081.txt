Every summer there are million people on their way to their holidays; they are going by train, car or aeroplane and travelling all around the world. They are ready to enjoy everything, they are offered - the sun, cheap food, sunbathing, lying topless on the beach, going out in the night and having drinks, climbing in the mountains, biking, surfing or swimming. But some of them seem to forget too easily, that they are visitors of a foreign country. There are tourists, that behave as if the beach were their own living-room. There seems to be no respect to the people and their cultural values; it really makes me furious, when I think of people sitting in a restaurant, only wearing a bikini or strolling through the city to do some shopping without dressing in a correct way. The question arises, if they state this as a rule for them being in holidays. Noone would do such a thing at home, but some tourists seem to have never heard of any rules and regulations.
This strange behaviour is often very annoying for the inhabitants, but they are tolerating a great deal, because they are depending on the money from the tourism.
I remember one day, when I was visiting a church in Greece, two barely dressed ladies, wearing hot-pants and a glittering gold-bustier, their skin was burnt red from the sun and they had both the appearance of Miss Piggy from the muppets show would like to visit the church, too.
Certainly this was not allowed, because in Greece you have to wear at least long trousers and a t-shirt, when you enter a church. They were not allowed to go in and after a lot of argueing they were sent away. In the evening I saw them again in a restaurant, quarreling over this incident; They hadn't learnt anything from it and what is still worse, they will not change their behaviour in foreign countries in the future. Some tourists will never learn to behave.
