More and more people demand, that cars ought to be banned from the cities. When I strolled through the city of Augsburg last week, I had to stifle my breath. Greys clouds of exhaust fumes descended from every car which waited for the green light to come on. The smell of petrol and oil made me feel sick. The latest poll about pollution in cities showed, that the "Königsplatz" is, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, one of the places with the highest air-pollution in Germany. The concentration of carbon monoxide which is supposed to cause asthma and cancer turned out to be at a menacing level.
Besides, many car-drivers are not willing to adjust to the speed limit of 50 km/h in towns and cities. The police lately reported about 37 pedestrians which had died in an accident or had been injured by a car last year; twenty of them had been children.
Exhaust fumes are proved to destroy our environment. In January a crowd of environmentalists and historians marched through the old city of Augsburg. They protested against the increasing destruction of the "Fuggerei" and the statue in front of the huge cathedral by break-down products, emerging from the enumerous cars, which drive through the beautiful restored centre of Augsburg every day. The thick walls of the medieval buildings crumble and become black all over. The golden statue is badly attacked by the aggressive acid chemicals in the exhaust fumes of the cars.
No wonder, that more and more people leave their car at home, when they plan to go shopping in the city, with the dangers of cars becoming more and more visible.
