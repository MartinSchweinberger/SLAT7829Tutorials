Say the provocative sentence "foreigners are no longer welcome in Germany" and usually people will disagree and accuse you of being too extreme or unfair. Don't we have a lot of foreigners here? Didn't we protest against skinheads and racism on the streets with candles in our hands? Yes we did, and still I think that generally, foreigners are not welcome anymore. I could write about the new law for asylants, making it almost impossible for a foreigner to plead asylum here, or about the various attacs on foreigners. But I think the most important thing is the way the general opinion, the "spirit" of the people as you may call it, has turned against foreigners in this country. A friend of mine, a twenty-year-old girl that has lived in Munich all her life, has a white mother and a coloured father. In the last two years, she suffered more discriminations than in the eighteen years before: Once, a shop assistant refused to attend her. Another time, in the evening, somebody shouted "Nigger Whore" after her. Whenever my friend sees a skinhead, she gets scared. But according to her, the worst thing is the way people look at her sometimes: In their eyes she reads fear and distrust. Nothing worse has happened so far and I don't think it will, but the sheer fact that my friend is afraid to go out alone at night and hates to take a bus ride alone, is horrible enough for me.
But I still think that people can - and will, hopefully - change their opinion again. Today morning I took the bus to Augsburg. When the bus stopped at the "Königplatz" a little old lady with two huge bags wanted to get out. Immediatly, a young coloured man who was standing by the door, came to help her, lifted the bags out of the bus and then took her arm to guide her safely down the steps onto the pavement. She smiled gratefully at him and the last thing I saw as the bus drove away, was them standing at the bus stop, talking to each other.
