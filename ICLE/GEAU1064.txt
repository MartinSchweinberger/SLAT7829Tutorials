When being an emancipated woman was all the rage there were lots of women who wanted to be one of them. This trend has "cooled down" but is not completely over. In some foreign countries women are still like "slaves": they have to scrub the floor, cook dinner and take care of the children. They look and act like little scared and helpless children. In Europe though there are many self-confident, independent women. They want to behave like men but at the same time get complements, have doors held open for them and get served first. They are the first to raise their voice and feel offended in a discussion. Bad enough emancipation sometimes draws together greens, anti-authoritarian mothers and women only eating "bio-food". Once I was riding on a bus and a little boy was sitting in front of me next to his mother. He was a very nasty, loud little boy. All of a sudden he turned towards me and started making funny faces, and sticking his tongue out. Then he pulled my earlobe. I really had enough and complained to his mother. She only said that she raised her child anti-authoritarian and was an unmarried, emancipated women. There are of course really emancipated women, too, that only want to have equal rights for men and women. They fight managers that give a job to Mr. Jones just because he is male and because he surely won't get pregnant. There are women who dare to stand up for the rights of their nation. A woman even won the nobel-prize of peace and a woman might even be elected chancelor or president. This was thought impossible not very long ago.
