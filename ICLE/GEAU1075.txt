One very important point is that you can visit as many courses as you are interested in like history, geography, physical education and perhaps education although you don't really need it for your exam. Of course you first try to do all courses you need but it is very often a big problem to get into these courses because they are so overcrowded and often only admitted to higher semester. But with a little luck you can manage to do all courses without having to wait too long and thus you can do your exam in the four of five years you had imagined to do it. Being allowed to visit a course with about thirty people you surely will get to know new fellow students who will help you with your problems or of course also will be willing with great enthusiasm to go in a pub or cafeteria in your spare time. But it is not only the new students who get you to know it is also the professor who often gets to know his students. Thus you can go to him and tell him your problem and he will often solve it quickly and without having to think about it too long. This is another important argument that university is not waste of time. That you can have confidence to your professor and that you can be sure he will help you when it is possible for him. A last also important point is that you are able to do practica in the school or other job you are studying for. Thus you get the insurance if the way you have choosen is the right way or if it is not. If it is the right thing you can do go on studying without sorrows about the coming future and if it is not the right thing you wanted to do it is most of the time early enough to have a new start.
Because of all this arguments I think it is no waste of time to go to university.
