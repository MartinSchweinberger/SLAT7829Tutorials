The old man was slendering across the cold surface of the (railway) unfriendly hall of the railway station. He was tired, his eyes were half-closed and his dirty and muddy hat nearly covered (his eyes) them. The old, used clothes where hanging down on him while he tired to get his cigarette box out of his jacket. He didn't succeed. He shook his head with resignment and continued walking through the empty hall. It was late at night and everything in the hall was polished till clinical tidiness. It was him who did it and so his working day was going to end in a few minutes after the last train, a trans-continental would arrive.
The old man didn't know that this one train would destroy all his efforts because in its tremendous body the train was carrying an explosive load, namely over 200 tourists that were ready to invade the old man's town.
And so it was. It seemed like a gigantic stampede when the train arrived and set the mob free. Like an enormous wave caused by subaquatic earthquakes the crowd rushed in and transformed the silent and clean-kept waiting hall into an overcrowded loud and noisy market hall, where children were screaming and yelling, trying to find their mothers, men were hurrying around looking for a place where alcoholic drinks were sold, women were looking for souveniers.
The old man was just sitting in one corner, trying to get all these things in his head.
He had to get used to these kind of visitors because his town had been discovered as a touristic attraction.
