I have known this charming girl for six months. She is about my age, but she has gone through a lot more. Before I met her for the very first time, she had been travelling around the world for 2 years. On her trip through Yugoslavia she found the love of her life: Goran, whom she brought to Germany 2 months ago. Now she is earning their livings by marketing sweets produced in the former German Democratic Republic. Vicky is proud of being a Kiwi and, thus, she is really - maybe a little too - self-confident. But nevertheless I feel devoted to this cultured, educated, enchanting, open-minded, and fascinating girl, who had left her native beloved country to find adequate work abroad. Although she had graduated in communication studies, it was impossible for her to get a job in New Zealand. I know that she sometimes feels home-sick, especially after calling her mother at home. But she intends to return home in 1993, after having married her fiance Goran; a marriage I am looking forward to. Maybe there is a chance to visit my courageous and remarkable, rosy-cheeked and snub-nosed and freckle-faced friend in her native country in 1994. Then we will remember the time in good old Landsberg, the difficulties in finding a flat for her, the endless conversations about relationships, the parties we organiszed together, and the trips to Munich and the Alpes to show her the features of my country.
I am afraid I will miss her more than I can imagine now: Vicky, a person whom I admittedly admire and who is worth meeting.
