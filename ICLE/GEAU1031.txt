In view of all the ecologic catastrophies and their terrible consequences on the ecologic system, man has become aware of the fact that something must be done to prevent nature from dying. According to specialists, we have to change our attitude towards ecology if we want to preserve our earth for the next generations. Therefore, we were told to collect materials separately, that remain in the household. Certain, this is not exceptional, but it is a first step. Moreover, we got to know that the layer of ozone was decreasing which is due to the use of certain gazes. As a consequence, we try to resolve the problem by not using or reducing the responsible gazes. Nowadays, we know that it is mankind that is the main destructor of nature, but on the other hand, we depend on our ecologic system. That is to say that we are not able to live without the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Yet, there are the first indications that we have caused damages which cannot be repared. But it is by no means too late to find solutions to this problem.
