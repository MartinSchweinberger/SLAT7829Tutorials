We have a lot of problems here on earth. Hunger, poorness, education, environment and many more. Are there not many more problems have to be solved before it comes to the point of being ecology-conscious for everyone of us? I think it's true that you first have to feet the people, give them a home and educate them, before you can count on their ecological consciousness. But that's not for every nation in the world. Some nations, the industrial nations, have a lot of educated people and they must start doing something. And while they are trying to solve the problems of hunger, poorness, education, environment a.s.o. in the third world countries they have to start solving the problems left at home. Everybody can do something and they don't have to wait until any other is starting. Everybody can separate his trash, can take a basket for shopping, can try to avoid trash by buying goods, can try to use his bike more often instead of his car and so on. You can have discussions with friends and try to make them think over what they are doing, try to convince them. You can buy only things which are produced ecological. There are so many more things you can do. I can't count them all and I don't want to. Everybody can do and must do everything possible for him. All in all it makes sense but everybody has to start right now. When this system would be successful in the industrialized countries we could help and teach the others. A system that would function if everybody contributes his part.
All countries on the whole world have only one environment and it's up to us, to everybody of us, to help it to survive. Because if the environment doesn't function any longer the exitus of men is just a matter of time. The human being will only have been a species in the history of the earth.
