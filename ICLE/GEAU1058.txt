"The more I get to know of people, the more I like my dog" - absolutely true as I can tell from my own experience with Sherry, a beautiful Irish-Setter-boy, that shared the twelve years of his life with me. It was love at the first glance and there was never a periode of boredom, sadness, betrayal or fight in our relationship as there is in any other relation between "man and woman". Sherry never thought of himself, he just wanted to please and obey me. Each time I talked to him he looked at me with his warm, soft, honest brown eyes and I knew he really listened to my words and believed me. He didn't need much to be happy and confident - no car, no villa, no cloths, no money, just some "dogy - cookies", a warm sleeping-place near my bed, long visits in the countryside and my company. He had no intension to make career or be successfull, except he had to search the little piece of wood I threw away again and again and this he did with his whole heart. Above all, there was never the jelous question "where have you been" or "what have you done" when I returned late; he was just happy that I returned at all, "danced" around me and barked as loud as he could.
Yes, it really seems to me, after all, "there's no friend like my dog-friend"!
