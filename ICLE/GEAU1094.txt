"Environmentally friendly" - what does that mean? I think it includes a lot of things: The first point for me is the abuse of cars. Everybody is driving everywhere with his car. This is only to feel oneself comfortable - but you can go a lot of ways by foot, by bike, by bus, streetcar, train or tube. Most time this tooks a little bit longer - but it would be worth it!
A further point is the consuming habit of people. Most of the people prefer buying tins or one-way-bottles instead of bottles and glasses you can use many times. If you pay attention you can reduce the amount of litter you are producing by yourself.
Wertstoffhof - that's also a password! You can divide your litter into paper, tins, brown, white and green glass, various sorts of plastic (PP, PE, PS and PET), aluminium, oil and fat and a few other things which are not that often in your dustbin. All these kinds of litter you can bring to the Wertstoffhof from which it is brought to recycling stations. It only takes you a few minutes a day to make this effort.
Moreover we should fight for better laws that save our environment. Everybody has to do something for this.
Finally I had to say that "environmentally friendly" is the new password of today. We have to be "environmentally friendly" and we have to convince other people of this need!
