	Nowadays is true that the science technology and the industialization are very important terms in our society, because the development of our society depends in some way of this things but this doesn't mena that there aren't place for dreams and imagination and use it to do a better things and help our world to be more confortable and better for all the people that live in it.
	Through the times people ever have had dreams and ideas to make a better world and this thoughts have been the base of all studies and development to get it. These people have begun a lot of investigations and in all of branches of the science to make their dreams real and all of us have an easier level of life.
	In our actual kind of life the technology and in general all the science are a fundamental base because a lot of things and products that we use in the common life are eleborated through chemical and technological way with some objetives: to get all this products better to our health, easier to get them, cheaper, cleaner to the nature protection and other advantages that thanks to the science studies are posible. Although I have to say that all of this advantages are an important sector in the value scale of the life, but they  aren't all in it, there are other things that are important in this scale too as the relations among the people and the dreams that these people say don't have place for them.
	Nowadays in the middle of this kind of life based in the comodity and the try to be in a high level of life, exist still a lot of people or almost all of them that have a dream or an utopia that wish to make real and perhaps a lot of these people try it seriously because they think that their cause is right and is important to all the people that will be real, as to help the people that can't get these products what I said before, because their kind of life is not as our and some times don't have food either.
	Nevertheless everybody have ever a dream or an anxiousness that feed his soul to look for some that don't have in their lifes and if this dreams or thoughts don't exist, mena couldn't live good because their lifes should be monotonous and without a piece of hapyness.
	Nevertheless the both terms, technology or science and reams will be together in the future because the science will continue advancing to do the kind of life result useless and too that there aren't place for them in this world but I think that they are an essential part of the mind of the people and don't ought die although we live in a world based in a consumist society.
	The dreams ought to live now and forever over all the material things.
