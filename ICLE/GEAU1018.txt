Almost every week you can read articles about the catastrophic influences of cars to the nature. Therefore a rising number of people wishes that cars ought to be banned.
The most important reason for them is that cars destroy the nature.
First the cars produce exhaust fumes which pollute the air. Fifty per cent of the conifers in the Alps are destroyed according to the last poll. Rare plants, the Alpenveilchen and the Silberdistel, are laid to rest.
Second the noise of the cars is a danger to the people.
Mr. Adams and his family who have lived for ten years close by the highway from Munich to Salzburg have got strong headache and their capability to hear has got worse.
And third an increasing number of new highways, motorways, trunks, streets and alleys covers our country. This fact reduces the space of animals to live in. Deers, birds, rats have to flie into one of the few streets and areas without traffic.
These effects show that - when there is no change in people's mind - the air pollution, the danger of the noise, and the streets covering the whole country is nothing than a time-bomb.
It is not possible to forbid cars, but to create car-free-areas in cities. Ingolstadt has invented that you park your car outside the town and go by bus to the city centre - there is no car allowed in the whole city. Another possibility is to build groups of four to five people, who use one car so that you use the full capacity of the car.
Just to say, cars ought to be banned, is too easy, we cannot give up them. But we have to learn to reduce the use of them to a minimal extend.
