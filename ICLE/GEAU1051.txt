Before I first went to England, I had already heard lots of horror-stories about English food: about fish and chips with vinegar, tasteless cabbage and greasy hamburgers. With these expectations, I participated at a pupils' exchange in order to make my own experiences.
And really! I was welcomed with oily fish, fried potatoes and pies, which I literally took with a pinch of salt. The next morning, the smell of coffee and crispy toast tickled my nose, so that the breakfast made up for the supper. I joined my friend to go to school where we were supposed to have lunch at the student canteen. The customs of the English pupils there somewhat surprised me. Instead of having some nutritious potato-salad with sausages and grilled tomatoes, which appeared quite tasty to me, they grabbed one or two bags of crisps and devoured them with obvious delight.
A few days later, I was served plum-pudding as a dessert. Although I generally like everything that is sweet, I really had difficulties in enjoying this wobbly mass of jelly. But not all the English cooking is dreadful and insipid! Once you've tried one of those lovely stews, you'll never forget the spicy taste of the mutton and way the potatoes seem to be melting away on your tongue. Or take porridge, which has a bad reputation, but with some honey it is in fact an ideal and healthy start into the day. True, chips with vinegar are a tonguesore, but try them with mayonnaise as some of the English do, you will get to like them. And there is nothing more delicious than a "continental breakfast" as it is served in hotels all over the world. Scrambled eggs, hot sausages, tomatoes, cereals ... all this will help you to bring home the bacon during the day. If you're not yet convinced about the quality English food can have, don't bother, go over to the British Isles and form your own impression.
