I don't quite agree with the sentence. Yes, certainly science and technology influence people very much. People become more practical they spend a lot of time on his job and they haven't got enough time on dreaming and imagination. And the speed of life becomes very fast.
The great progress in the field of information science, computerization, transport and growing standards of life has led to that a lot of people reached the limit of their dreaming or consider their dreaming as real, and they think it will be easy to reach the dreams .
Besides the industry of entertainments is so developed now that instead of dreaming and imagination one spends his or her spare time sometimes only watching TV set.
But I would hardly say that people stop to dream at all. In any time there were not so many people, whose dreams was very serious. (For example, Jules Verne, Herbert Wells, Alexander Belyaev). Now in many countries there are a lot of famous fantasts. Isn't it dreams. The writer's books have a lot of fans and I think it's illustration of that people can dream and imagine. And I want to end the little essey by the words of Napoleon "Imagination rules the world" and the words of Richter "Recollection is the only paradize from which we cannot be turned out".
