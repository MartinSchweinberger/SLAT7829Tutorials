Visiting friends of my family in Bath I learnt important facts about cooking in England. Being a typical greenhorn I made some beginner's faults. I soon found out that even in convincing tasting bakeries you should buy only these things you can guess out of what they are made.
But keep away from pies and cakes because they are stiffy, oily and full of soft, wet currants - and that horribly full of sugar that it nearly hurts your teeth.
One day I decided to splurge, and getting hungry I went to a nearby fish and chip shop. Tasting the smell that disturbed the air around the shop, I started wondering why fish and chips is that famous in England. When I held the fish and the chips in my hand, fat, mixed with salt and vinegar, was oozing through the paper onto my palm.
Feeling deeply disappointed and my stomach hanging over the ground, I edged my way to an Indian restaurant with a quiet, friendly and distinguished waiter. Soon I experienced that in England you can have very delicious food - in Indian, Chinese or Mexican restaurants, where you can fully trust in the cooks.
