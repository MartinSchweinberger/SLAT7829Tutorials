In former times I couldn't understand all the people, who got up early on a Sunday morning, just to walk with their dogs.
I wouldn't get up for such a lousy bastard, I thought, but the more I got to know of people, my attitude towards dogs changed.
Do you know one friend of yours, that'll wait for you patently while you're stuck in traffic. That'll do whatever you tell him to do. That'll always be there if you're feeling sad and lonely. That are just three points where you have to admitt that a dog, no matter what size or colour will fulfill.
I remember the time I was touring with my parents in the mountains. I hated these holidays, where you had to climb up a mountain for three hours, just in order to find your way down again.
We were walking on a tiny path that was searching his way, in serpentines through the wood just big enough to let one person walk on it, on one side the stones and some rare bushes like a wall on the other side, well, you'll better try not to look down.
We started hearing some noise made by a dog, and as we got closer we saw already a terrier coming towards us, constantly barking and making the hell of a noise. He was jumping up and down, still barking, as if he was trying to tell us something. He guided us, and we found a man, belonging to that same dog, who fell down a few meters and couldn't move anymore. There was just a little tree to which he could hang on, not to fall totally down.
We could get help for that man, but if the dog wouldn't have gained our attention, we never would have recognized him.
His dog really saved his life, and I think he wouldn't mind at all to get up on a cold December Sunday morning to walk with him instead of lying in his cosy warm, bed till noon.
