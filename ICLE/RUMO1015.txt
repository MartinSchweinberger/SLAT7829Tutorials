Certainly most of the thesis, which are written to get a degree, are theoretical and haven't any practical value. One of the reason is unnecessary theorizing when students study in the university. During post-graduate study the teaching continues in the same way. Accordingly as a rule the thesis are theoretical. Besides I think it's easier to find something new theoretical than to make a discovery having any practical value. Thus there is an exclusive curcle: the theorizing in the university gives birth to the theorizing by scientists and returns through the teaching staff in the institute. Of course the fact influences on the preparing of students for real life. Nevertheless I think it's not worth to dramatize the situation for the discovery, which haven't any practical value nowadays, gets very often the value tomorrow. I think that in the first place universities must give a theoretical base which students will use in real life. Though it would perfect to balance theoretical and practical sides of education and universities must strive for it. But since there isn't the balance, I think that the emphasis on the theoretical side is more important. It is universities that should teach students who will work on fundamental research.
It is difficult for me to speak of the subject because I amn't an authority in the field, but the problem  is complicated and disputable and it demands of special learning by experts.
