That's true. And it is more actual now in the 20th century. Our planet is covered with a net of plants and factories. Their huge chimneys discharge harmful gases and tons of poisoned chemical substances into the air every minute. Mother Nature is declining. It is going to be dead unless something is done to those dreadfull chimnies. To say nothing about water and soil pollution. The scale of ecological catashtophies are sometimes horrifying. And they occur oftener and ofterner every year. The situation is dangerous. And it threatens our children's lives.
What ought to be done to that? All thinking people should unite under the green banner. Strict ecological monitoring should be established. Let's help nature. Plant and factories should be modernized and turned to ecologically friendly. Scientists should keep an eye on those kinds of animals, birds and fish that disappears. Unfortunately it's too late to restore many of them.
Deep pockets are reluctant to do anything about it. They get benefits paying no attention to anything else. It's just unprofitable to retrofit their plants. to make them clean for environment. It costs a pretty penny. The big fishes should be forced to take care of nature by law. It is for the public to draw everybody's attention to the problem of centuries.
