It is not simply to make professional army. But some countries experience shows that nowadays an army consists of entirely professional soldiers is the most mobile and capable of accomplish any mission. Certainly, such an army requires a lot of money because, it is, naturally, every soldier must get rather high salary and to have some priveleges providing his standard of living, his way of life. As a rule, a professional soldier is older than a recruiter and he has a certain preparation. There is no need explain much to a professional soldier about importance of military service, strong discipline and so on. While the young men which are drafted are needed on a great attention. Some of them leave the Army at once they don't want to serve at all whatever conditions you make for them. Besides, the problem is that the newcomers, sometimes, are being beaten by so-called "old soldiers". It makes the officers a lot of troubles. A man must be interested in military service. At the present time only money may attract men and, of course, women to serve in the Army. But I suppose, it is impossible in the near future. The problem is money. As for this country as long the situation is bad as the Army's problems are not solved including professional draft. In my opinion, compulsory military service has exhausted itself or at least there must be alternative service. So any army must be not large but almost consists of professional soldiers.
